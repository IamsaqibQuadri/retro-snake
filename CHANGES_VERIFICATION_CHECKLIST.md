# 🎮 Snake Game Changes Verification Checklist

## ✅ **How to Test All Your Requested Changes**

### 🚀 **Step 1: Start the Game**
1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`
2. The main menu should load with Arabian Nights music playing

### 🎨 **Step 2: Check Unified Settings Icon (FIXED)**
**What to look for:**
- ✅ Only **TWO** icons in top-right corner (Sound + One Settings icon 🎨)
- ❌ Should **NOT** see 3+ separate icons anymore
- ✅ Click the 🎨 icon to open unified panel

**Expected Result:** Single customization panel with 3 tabs:
- 🎨 Themes
- 🐍 Snake Skins  
- 🎨 Snake Colors

### 🎵 **Step 3: Test Arabian Nights Music (FIXED)**
**What to listen for:**
- ✅ More complex, exotic melody (not simple repetitive tune)
- ✅ Middle Eastern scale with characteristic intervals
- ✅ Irregular rhythm patterns (authentic Arabian feel)
- ✅ 12-second duration
- ✅ Softer, more mystical volume

**Test:** Enable sound and listen on main menu

### 🎲 **Step 4: Test Large Dice Numbers (FIXED)**
**How to test:**
1. Click 🎨 icon → Snake Skins tab → Select "Dice" 
2. Start a game (any speed/mode)
3. Look at your snake

**What to check:**
- ✅ Dice symbols (⚀⚁⚂⚃⚄⚅) should be **LARGE and clearly visible**
- ✅ Black dice symbols with white outline for contrast
- ✅ Different dice numbers on each snake segment
- ✅ Thick black borders (3px) around each segment
- ❌ Should **NOT** be tiny/unreadable anymore

### 🌈 **Step 5: Test Theme Contrast (FIXED)**
**Themes to test:**

#### **Game Boy Theme:**
1. Click 🎨 → Themes → "Game Boy Retro" 
2. Check ALL text is **black and readable**
3. Green background with black text everywhere

#### **Pastel Theme:**
1. Click 🎨 → Themes → "Pastel Dreams"
2. Check ALL text is **black and readable** 
3. Soft colors with black text everywhere

**What to verify:**
- ✅ **NO** green text on green background
- ✅ **ALL** text should be black (`#000000`)
- ✅ Buttons, menus, scores all clearly visible
- ✅ Proper contrast on cards, popups, and game elements

### 🎯 **Step 6: Full Game Flow Test**
1. **Main Menu:** Arabian music + unified settings
2. **Game Setup:** Choose speed/mode with good contrast
3. **Countdown:** 3-2-1 with visible text
4. **Gameplay:** Test dice snake skin with large numbers
5. **Game Over:** Check score display visibility
6. **Settings:** Test all theme/color combinations

## 🔧 **Quick Issue Resolution**
