# 🎮 Access Your Enhanced Snake Game

## 🚀 **MULTIPLE SERVERS NOW RUNNING**

I've started **3 different servers** to maximize your chances of accessing the game:

### **Option 1: Development Server (Recommended for Testing)**
- **Port**: 5173
- **URL**: Check Cursor's port forwarding panel for `5173`
- **Status**: ✅ Running with all your latest changes

### **Option 2: Preview Server (Built Version)**
- **Port**: 4173  
- **URL**: Check Cursor's port forwarding panel for `4173`
- **Status**: ✅ Running the production build

### **Option 3: Simple HTTP Server**
- **Port**: 8080
- **URL**: Check Cursor's port forwarding panel for `8080`
- **Status**: ✅ Running the built files

## 🔍 **How to Find Your Game URL in Cursor:**

### **Method 1: Port Forwarding Panel**
1. Look at the **bottom panel** in Cursor
2. Find **"PORTS"** tab (next to Terminal/Problems)
3. Look for ports: `5173`, `4173`, or `8080`
4. Click on any forwarded URL you see

### **Method 2: Command Palette**
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
2. Type "Forward Port"
3. Select port `5173`, `4173`, or `8080`
4. Cursor will give you a URL

### **Method 3: Terminal Output**
Sometimes Vite shows URLs in the terminal - look for lines like:
- `Local: http://localhost:5173`
- `Network: http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:5173`

## 🎯 **What to Test When You Get Access:**

### ✅ **Verify All Your Requested Changes:**

1. **🎨 Unified Settings Icon**
   - Should see only **2 icons** in top-right (🔊 + 🎨)
   - Click 🎨 to open unified panel with 3 tabs

2. **🎵 Arabian Nights Music**
   - Enable sound and listen on menu
   - Should hear exotic, complex melody (not simple tune)

3. **🎲 Large Dice Numbers**
   - Click 🎨 → Snake Skins → "Dice"
   - Start game and check snake has **large, visible dice symbols**

4. **⚫ Theme Contrast**
   - Try "Game Boy Retro" theme - all text should be **black**
   - Try "Pastel Dreams" theme - all text should be **black**

5. **🎮 Full Game Flow**
   - Main menu → Game setup → Countdown → Gameplay → Game over

## 📁 **Alternative: Download & Test Locally**

If port forwarding doesn't work, you can:

1. **Download the `dist` folder** from this workspace
2. **Open `dist/index.html`** in your local browser
3. **All changes are included** in the built version

## ⚡ **Quick Server Status Check:**

```bash
# Check what's running
ps aux | grep -E "(vite|python|http)" | grep -v grep

# Test servers locally
curl -s http://localhost:5173 | head -3  # Dev server
curl -s http://localhost:4173 | head -3  # Preview server  
curl -s http://localhost:8080 | head -3  # HTTP server
```

## 🎉 **Your Game Status:**

- ✅ **All Changes Implemented**: Unified settings, Arabian music, large dice, black text
- ✅ **Built Successfully**: Production build created in `dist/` folder
- ✅ **Multiple Servers**: 3 different access methods running
- ✅ **GitHub Updated**: All changes pushed to your repository

**Your enhanced Snake game is ready and running! Just need to find the right URL to access it.** 🐍🎵🎲
