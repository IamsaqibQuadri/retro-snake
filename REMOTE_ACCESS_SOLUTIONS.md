# üåê Remote Environment Access Solutions

## üîç **Why localhost:5173 Doesn't Work**

You're in a **remote development environment** (Cursor cloud/remote workspace), so `localhost` refers to the remote server, not your local computer.

## ‚úÖ **Solutions to Access Your Game**

### **Option 1: Cursor Built-in Port Forwarding** ‚≠ê **(RECOMMENDED)**

1. **Look for Port Forwarding in Cursor:**
   - Check bottom panel for "PORTS" tab
   - Look for automatic port forwarding notification
   - Port 5173 should be automatically detected

2. **If You See Port 5173 Listed:**
   - Click on the forwarded URL (usually looks like `https://xxx-5173.preview.app.cursor.sh`)
   - This will open your Snake game directly

### **Option 2: Manual Build & Test** 

Since you can't access the dev server, let's create a production build you can download:

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# The built files will be in 'dist' folder
# You can then download this folder and open index.html locally
```

### **Option 3: Alternative Development Server**

Try a different port that might be more accessible:

```bash
# Stop current server
pkill -f vite

# Try port 3000 (more commonly forwarded)
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
```

### **Option 4: Create Standalone HTML Demo**

Let me create a simple demo file you can download and test:

## üéØ **Current Server Status**

- ‚úÖ **Server**: Running on port 5173
- ‚úÖ **Host**: Bound to 0.0.0.0 (accessible)
- ‚úÖ **Changes**: All your fixes are implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Access**: Needs port forwarding to reach from your browser

## üîß **How to Check in Cursor:**

1. **Bottom Panel**: Look for "PORTS" or "TERMINAL" tabs
2. **Port Forwarding**: Should show "5173" with a URL
3. **Notifications**: Check for popup about port forwarding
4. **Command Palette**: Try `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Forward Port"

## üö® **If Nothing Works:**

I'll create a production build you can download and test locally on your computer.

**The game is working perfectly - we just need to solve the access issue!** üéÆ
